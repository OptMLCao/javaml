/**
 * 欧式距离.
 * This class implements the Euclidean distance.
 * <p>
 * The Euclidean distance between two points P=(p1,p2,...,pn) and
 * Q=(q1,q2,...,qn) in the Euclidean n-space is defined as: sqrt((p1-q1)^2 +
 * (p2-q2)^2 + ... + (pn-qn)^2)
 * <p>
 * The Euclidean distance is a special instance of the NormDistance. The
 * Euclidean distance corresponds to the 2-norm distance.
